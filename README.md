# Monopoly ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB.svg?style=flat&logo=Python&logoColor=white)
This is a single-player (1v1 against the computer) implementation of the classic boardgame Monopoly using the Python Arcade library.

This project was a group project from my class on software engineering, but all code that wasn't sourced directly from the Python Arcade documentation was written from scratch.
